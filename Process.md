1. Went on ‘Kraggle’ and search for datasets since I like true crime I searched up Homicides 
2. I looked over the data and saw the information to use it in Jupyter Notebook I downloaded as a csv file 
3. On the Jupyter Notebook, I import numpy and pandas because those libraries are suppose to help me understand the data more using certain functions in them 
4. Afterwards I brought in the dataset that I downloaded from ‘Kraggle’ and saved as a variable on Jupyter Notebook
5. I print out the variable to see if the data is displayed properly 
6. Next, I print out the columns in the dataset because when the data was displaying it cut some of the columns out 
7. I used the describe function to get the summary of the data I could see. The summary of the data showed 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile and the mean, median, and mode of the data column I wanted to describe 
8. Then I start to import the matplotlib.pyplot library. This library has built in functions that helps us build our histograms
9. Histograms is a type of graph that shows the distribution of data 
10. I used the histograms for each column so we can use distribution of the data throughout the coarse of the data 
11. Bins are intervals, this shows what that data is going by 
12. Boxplots are away to visualize the describe function 
13. To call a boxplot use the variable name of your data “.boxplot” 
14. We return the axes type because when that function wasn’t there it didn’t show the x and y axes. 
15. Next we choose the intervals of the each boxplot column. 
16. To give a guess of the intervals look at the the describe function and see where the data starts and ends to give a good estimate
